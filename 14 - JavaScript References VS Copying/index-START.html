    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // If we pass nothing, slice will make a copy of the arr
    team2[3] = 'Bobby';
    console.log('The players array: ' + players);
    console.log('The team2 array: ' + team2);
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log('The team3 array: ' + team3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    console.log('Using the ES6 spread: ');

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log('Team 5 using Array.from(players): ' + team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log('We added a reference using captain.number = 99, so now: ');
    console.log(captain);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 17});
    console.log('Person: ');
    console.log(person);
    console.log('Captain2: ');
    console.log(captain2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person};
    console.log(captain3);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // Until here is just a copy, but since it is shallow, it wil not change the 'sub-object', so
    // the social part will not work...
    wes2.social.twitter = '@radvitz';
    console.log('Now that we have changed the social part of the copy, lets see both:');
